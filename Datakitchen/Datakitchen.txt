rom dkutils.validation import validate_globals: The code imports a function called validate_globals 
from a Python module called dkutils.validation. It's not clear what this function does, but we'll 
assume it checks that some global variables have valid values.

try: ... except Exception as e: ...: The code sets up a try-except block, which means that it will 
attempt to run the code inside the "try" block, and if any exceptions (errors) occur, it will run
 the code inside the "except" block instead. If an exception occurs, it will be stored in the 
 variable e.

success == False: The code initializes a variable called success and sets its value to False. 
It seems like this variable will be used later to indicate whether the code succeeded or failed.

forecasted_sales_len = -1: The code initializes a variable called forecasted_sales_len and sets 
its value to -1.

min_forecast_sales = None: The code initializes a variable called min_forecast_sales and sets 
its value to None.

max_forecast_sales = None: The code initializes a variable called max_forecast_sales and sets 
its value to None.

validate_globals([...]): The code calls the validate_globals function and passes it a list of
 global variable names (which appear to be missing from the code snippet you provided). It's not 
 clear what this function does, but we'll assume it checks that the variables in the list have valid 
 values.

'MODEL_FILENAME', ... 'FORECASTED_SALES_FILENAME': This line seems to be part of the list of
 global variable names being passed to validate_globals. It's not clear why the list is split
 across multiple lines like this.

model = joblib.load(f'docker-share/{MODEL_FILENAME}'): The code loads a machine learning model
 from a file called MODEL_FILENAME, which is presumably located in a directory called docker-share. 
 It uses the joblib.load function from the joblib module to do this. The loaded model is assigned
 to a variable called model.

all_data_df = pd.read_csv(f'docker-share/{DATA_FOR_FORECASTING_FILENAME}'): The code loads a CSV
 file called DATA_FOR_FORECASTING_FILENAME, which is also presumably located in the docker-share 
 directory. It uses the pd.read_csv function from the pandas module to do this. The loaded data 
 is assigned to a variable called all_data_df.

feature_data_df = all_data_df.loc[:, FEATURES]: The code selects a subset of the loaded data
 using the loc method of the all_data_df DataFrame. It selects all rows (:) and the columns 
 specified in the FEATURES list. The resulting DataFrame is assigned to a variable called
 feature_data_df.

forecasted_sales = model.predict(feature_data_df): The code uses the predict method of the 
model object to generate sales forecasts based on the feature_data_df. The resulting forecasts
 are assigned to a variable called forecasted_sales.

min_forecast_sales = forecasted_sales.min(): The code calculates the minimum forecasted sales
 value by calling the min method on the forecasted_sales array. The resulting minimum value is 
 assigned to a variable called min_forecast_sales.

max_forecast_sales = forecasted_sales.max(): The code calculates the maximum forecasted sales 
value by calling the max
