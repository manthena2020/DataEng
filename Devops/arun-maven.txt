maven ==>>> apache.

Developers ==>> code ==>> push ==>> github ===>>> code ==>> maven ==>> build tool ==>> build ==>>> package ===>>> war / jar / ear ===>>copy ==>> tomcat ( webserver)===>> APP ==>> EU.

******* maven vs ant*****************

MAVEN : build tool

1. works for java based projects only

2. maven has life cycle.

3. maven works for project object based model.===>> maven ==>> pom.xml

4. defaultly junit test cases run..

5. maven has plugins ==>> plugins ==>> install ==>> extranal features adding to our project.

plugins are reusable.

6. maven checks the dependencys..


ANT : build tool

2. Ant has no life cycle.

3. ANT has build.xml

4. Ant does not checks junit test cases.

5. ant has scripts. ==>>> scripts are not reusable.

6. Ant does not checks dependencys..

maven works for project object based model..

maven ==>> pom.xml

pom.xml ==>> file ==>> written by developers..

Every project has one pom.xml

pom1.xml or pom.xml2

pom.xml has the fields 

groupid ==>> clientname or projectname ==>>> SBI

artifactid ==>> feturename ==>> Creditcard 

versionid ==>> threefields ==>> majorrelease.minorrelease.hotfix/bugfixrelease ==>>> 8.2.0

typeofpackage ==>>> war/jar/ear

properties ===>>>> sonarqube url link ( ops team)

dependencys ==>> 1.8 ===>> 1.7

distribution management ==>>> nexus url ===>> ( ops team)
